Sprconv is the 16-bit DOS version, texconv is the Win32 version (a bit more straightforward in how it functions).

List conversion usage: write filename with extension, then 1 or 0 depending if you want transparency or not, and then number of frames (if the game uses a format that has multiple frames in the same file, e.g. Amazeing).
