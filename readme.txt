Sprconv is the 16-bit DOS version, texconv is the Win32 version (a bit more straightforward in how it functions as we're not limited by 16-bit DOS memory management).

List conversion usage: write filename with extension, then 1 or 0 depending if you want transparency or not, and then number of frames (if the game uses a format that has multiple frames in the same file, e.g. Amazeing). Otherwise just use 1. Hit Enter and add the next file with the same information and so on until you're done.

See Rocket.txt for an example file.
